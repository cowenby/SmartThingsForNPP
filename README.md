# SmartThingsForNPP
This is a custom language configuration for NotePad++ syntax highlighting

1. Open Notepad++ (NPP)
2. Go to  View>User Defined Dialogue
3. Click the Import... button
4. Browse to the .xml file you downloaded from GitHub and click OK (You should receive a confirmation that import was successful)
5. You should now have the SmartThings language in the dropdown
6. You may need to close and reopen NotePad++
7. Open an existing or create a new file
8. In the Language menu, select SmartThings all the way at the bottom
9. Program Away!!
10. If you feel so inclined, feel free to add to the keyword types for applicable syntax groups

I am a novice programmer and am certainly open to suggestions as to how to categorize the different syntax groups. 
I tried to reflect (to some degree) the configuration of the ST browser based IDE.
